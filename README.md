# Landing Page To Demonstrate Basic Blockchain Interaction

This project demonstrates some basic functionality of a smart contract. This contract has been deployed on the *Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet* and can be viewed on [etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x7DaF02aC9006Ecdc3dA3a7011e7cE1F31AeD2508).

The front-end was made with React and can be viewed in this [Replit repo](https://replit.com/@ChimingPork/waveportal-starter-project#src/App.jsx)

[Check out my app!](https://waveportal-starter-project.chimingpork.repl.co)

## Using the app

- Connect to the app using a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) set to the [Rinkeby testnet](https://gist.github.com/tschubotz/8047d13a2d2ac8b2a9faa3a74970c7ef).
- Get some ETH from a [faucet!](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/rinkeby-testnet-faucets/25866)
- Type in a message and let's share some coffee and donuts :) Choose either the coffee or donut button to send the message 
  - This will be updated in the future to include minting of Coffee/Donut NFTs. 
- Your message should appear in a log once the transaction is verified and you refresh the page
- Check your wallet... You may have been lucky enough to win some test eth!
- If not try again by sending another message. (There will be a 15 minute cooldown before you can again, no spamming!)

### Work in Progress
Future implementations:
- Coffee/Donut transactions will allow minting of NFTs
